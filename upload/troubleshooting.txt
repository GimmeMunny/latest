Globals must be off at your server of localhost. 
In this case just get variables when these are being posted:

e.g.

$Name=$_REQUEST["Name"];
$Email=$_REQUEST["Email"];
$SomeOtherVariable=$_REQUEST["SomeOtherVariable"];

You will have to get every variable like above in the PHP script page at the top of page after when PHP code starts.
Globals Off is the dafault settings at server and localhost which is recommended. When Globals are off, you have to get variables like above.
